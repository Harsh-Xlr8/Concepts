# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### Question 1: What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can arise from various inappropriate actions, such as:

- Engaging in unsuitable conversations, gestures, or making intrusive eye contact.
- Unwelcome physical contact and jokes with a sexual undertone.
- Subjecting an individual to unwarranted attention and performing sexual acts in their presence.
- Making uninvited comments that seem like flattery but are discomforting.

### Question 2: What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

If I experience or witness such behavior, I would:

- Firmly ask the individual to cease their behavior.
- Politely but clearly tell them to leave my vicinity.
- Report the incident to the appropriate grievance or HR team.
- Discuss the situation with a supervisor or manager.
